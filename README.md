# Next-Blog

This is a Basic Blog made using [Next js](https://nextjs.org) and [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install

npm run dev

```

It was an attempt to learn to build a blog using [Next js](https://nextjs.org) and [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) which taught a lot of things like getStaticProps, getStaticPaths, [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), [highlightJs](https://highlightjs.org/) and lot more.

Special Thanks to [Brad](https://github.com/bradtraversy) for teaching me so much !
